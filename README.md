# DCASE2022-task6b

This repository contains code used to analyse correlation between text/audio complexity measures and human (as well as model) ratings of audio-text correspondences introduced at following repository 

https://github.com/xieh97/retrieval-relevance-crowdsourcing

The data for the analysis can be found at above repository.

The model folder contains a Keras implemention of audio_to_text retrieval model to replicate the baseline results for DCASE 2022 Challenge Task 6b.
The feature_extraction folder contains code for extracting audio and text features from clotho dataset used for the model training.

The baseline system of the task is originally implemented in the following repository:
